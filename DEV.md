# Development Guide

This document defines how humans and agents develop in this repository.

---

## Philosophy

- Code is a liability until proven correct
- Tests are executable documentation
- Git history is part of the product
- Small changes scale, big commits do not

---

## Test-Driven Development

All behavior changes MUST follow TDD:

1. Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
2. Run tests and observe failure
3. Implement the minimal solution
4. Run tests and observe success
5. Refactor only after green tests

If a change has no test, it is incomplete.

---

## Commit Discipline

Commits should be:

- Small
- Atomic
- Easy to review
- Easy to revert

### One Commit = One Idea

**Good:**
- Add parser
- Fix boundary condition
- Refactor function

**Bad:**
- Parser + refactor + formatting
- Feature + test cleanup
- "Misc fixes"

---

## pre-commit

This repository uses `pre-commit` as a hard gate.

Before committing, always run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Do not commit if hooks fail. Fix the issues first.

---

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest
uv run robot -d results robot/math

# Run specific test
uv run robot -d results -t "Test Name" robot/path/tests/file.robot

# Run pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files

# Check git status
git status
git diff
```
